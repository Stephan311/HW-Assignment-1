# HW-Assignment-1

1. 1st commmit I made was pushing my first changes to Github, which were linking the CSS sheet to the HTML File so the website would actually function properly.
2. Removed the "List Style type: none" attribute in the CSS, under the .header div ul class/element
3. Under .hero class, I removed the width: 100% attribute, this is unecessary
