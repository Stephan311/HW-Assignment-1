Introduction: For this project, I was given a website that a Marketing Agency is using, and they needed the code simplified and fixed so that
their site could be better optimized and function properly. So I did exactly this.

In this README, I will not go into techincal details, but I will go into the core fundamentals and concepts of what was done here. I will go through
what issues I faced, what challenges I had, and how I solved them. 

1. My First challenge I faced was the images of the website. When I would open it in my browser, images would not show up, instead the 
basic "image" icon was shown. I solved this by chaning the img src name, to what the images were named within the folder on my local PC, instead
of the bad links they were attatched to.
2. After this, I proceeded to simplify the actual code on the CSS side/sheet by grouping differnet elements and classes together who had the same
attrbutes being applied to them. Instead of having 20 lines of code in some section, I was able to narrow this down to around 5 lines of code, by grouping all of the elements together using commas, and applying the same attribute(s) to them.
3. The next big challange I faced was on the HTML side. One of the buttons/links inside the header of this website was not working. After looking
closley, I saw that this button linked to an ID which did not exist for the element in the page it was linking to. I created an ID for said element, using approiate names, and it worked.
4. I also arranged the order of the various CSS elements to apprporiately follow the HTML structure and order, so everything made sense.
5. Lastly, I added comments to every section in the CSS file to let the viewer know exactly what sections of the website were being styled so they could better understand it.

In conclusion, this site's code has been simplefied, and it is now much more accessible. I faced 5 main challenges in this project, plus a few other minor ones that are included in my commits. A large part of this project was trial and error. Trying to simplify code, and seeing what effect (if any) it had on the appearence or functionality of the website.
