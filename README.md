# HW-Assignment-1
Introduction: For this project, I was given a website that a Marketing Agency is using, and they needed the code simplified and fixed so that
their site could be better optimized and function properly.

In this README, I will not go into techincal details, but I will go into the core fundamentals and concepts of what was done here. I will go through
what issues I faced, what challenges I had, and how I solved them.

1. My First challenge I faced was the images of the website. When I would open it in my browser, images would not show up, instead the 
basic "image" icon was shown. I solved this by chaning the img source name, to what the images were named within the folder on my local PC, instead
of the bad links they were attatched to.
2. After this, I proceeded to simplify the actual code on the CSS side/sheet by grouping differnet elements and classes together who had the same
attrbutes being applied to them. Instead of having 20 lines of code, I was able to narrow this down to around 5 lines of code, by grouping all of the elements together using commas, and applying the same attribute(s) to them.
3. The next big challange I faced was on the HTML side. One of the buttons/links on inside the header of this website was not working. After looking
closley, I saw that this button linked to an ID which did not exist for the element in the page it was linking to. I created an ID for said element
using approiate names, and it worked.


1. 1st commmit I made was pushing my first changes to Github, which were linking the CSS sheet to the HTML File so the website would actually function properly.
2. Tags on the images were changed, so they could show up properly. I renamed all of the files and put the new names in.
3. Grouped a bunch of image classes who had the same thing being done to them under one line and made the command perform the same thing for them.
4. Again, I grouped 3 image classes together into one line who had the same thing being done to them.
5. Elements and classes kept on being grouped together who had the same attributes given to them. This accounts for multiple commits
6. Next, I made my first change in the HTML. I added an ID to the class "search-engine-optimization", for the link to work in the header
