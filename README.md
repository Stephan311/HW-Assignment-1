# HW-Assignment-1

1. 1st commmit I made was pushing my first changes to Github, which were linking the CSS sheet to the HTML File so the website would actually function properly.
2. Tags on the images were changed, so they could show up properly. I renamed all of the files and put the new names in.
3. Grouped a bunch of image classes who had the same thing being done to them under one line and made the command perform the same thing for them.
4. Again, I grouped 3 image classes together into one line who had the same thing being done to them.
